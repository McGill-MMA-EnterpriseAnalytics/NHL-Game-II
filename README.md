## Overview and Business implication



## Static data 

The static data source (from part 1 of this project) is from:

Here are the definitions of features used for this project:
- "won": Did the team win the game?
- "Shots": Number of shots
- "Shots_Against": Number of shots of opponent team
- "Goals": Number of goals
- "Goals_against": Number of goals of opponent team
- "Takeaways": Number of Takeaways
- "Takeaways_against": Number of Takeaways of opponent team
- "Hits": Number of hits
- "Hits_against": Number of hits of opponent team
- "Blocked shots": Number of blocks shots
- "Blocked shots against": Number of blocks shots of opponent team
- "Giveaways": Number of Giveaways
- "Giveaways_against": Number of Giveaways of opponent team
- "Missed shots": Number of missed shots
- "Missed shots_against": Number of missed shots of opponent team
- "Penalties": Number of penalties
- "Penalties_against": Number of penalties of opponent team
- "#Won faceoffs": Number of won faceoffs
- "#Lost faceoffs": Number of lost faceoffs
- "HoA_away": Is the team away?
- "HoA_home": Is the team at home?

The static dataset is [Period_1_Game_Stats_Final_ModelReady(April-10th-2022).csv](https://github.com/McGill-MMA-EnterpriseAnalytics/NHL-Game-II/blob/main/Period_1_Game_Stats_Final_ModelReady(April-10th-2022).csv).
